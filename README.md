## Introduction
CubeSats are miniaturized satellites used for research in space. This project builds a small CubeSat prototype (4 x 4 x 4 cm, weighing 50g) that performs object detection using AI and monitors environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The project integrates an ESP-32 Cam Module for object detection and a DHT11 sensor for environmental data collection.
## Features
* AI Object Detection: Detects objects in space using the onboard ESP-32 Cam Module.
* Environmental Monitoring: Measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.
* Data Logging: Captured data is stored locally on an SD card.
* Wireless Transmission: Object detection results are transmitted via Wi-Fi.
## Hardware Components
* Arduino Pro Mini (ATmega328P)
* ESP-32 Cam Module
* DHT11 Sensor (for temperature and humidity)
* 2 x Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Batteries (3.7V, 300mAh)
* Wires and connectors
## Software Requirements
